                <h2>Description</h2>

                        <p> I would have loved having uploaded this recipe a long time ago, but I had to wait for my travel to Chile to make it and taste it
                             with the authentic flavors of this dish, that is so typical Chilean. This recipe uses a seasonal corn, available during the 
                             Chilean summer, besides of the cranberry beans it requires. Here in the United States I can find a similar kind of bean, but 
                             I must confess that they don’t really taste exactly the same, but they’re still quite tasty.</p>

                            

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        <ul>

                            <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil </li>
                            <li>1 small onion, chopped into squares  </li>
                            <li>1 clove of minced garlic  </li>
                            <li>Salt, paprika, pepper, and cumin to taste  </li>
                            <li>1 1/2 kg (3.3 lb) of cranberry beans  </li>
                            <li>2 corns  </li>
                            <li>1/4 kg (about 1/2 lb) of pumpkin (or squash)   </li>
                            <li>8 basil leaves  </li>
                          

                        </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Thrash the beans (i.e. remove them from their husks), chop the corns, wash and chop the pumpkin into medium-sized cubes.
                            </li>
                            <li>In a large pot, cook with enough hot water to cover the beans and chopped pumpkin, add a little salt and about 4 basil leaves. 
                                Cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes.
                            </li>
                            <li>Meanwhile make a stir-fry sauce in a pan with oil, onion chopped in squares, garlic, chopped basil, and the remaining spices. 
                                It takes about 7 minutes, more or less.
                            </li>
                            <li> Meanwhile add the corn to the mixture of beans, and cook for about 5 more minutes.
                            </li>
                            <li>Then add the stir-fry sauce that was prepared, stir well and cook for about 3 more minutes.</li>

                            <li>Let it stand and serve with basil on top or with “color”, which is basically red pepper powder with some lard or melted butter.</li>
                            




                        </ol>
